	abstract = {We performed RNA-seq and high-resolution mass spectrometry on 128 blood samples from COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients with diverse disease severities and outcomes. Quantified transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and lipids were associated with clinical outcomes in a curated relational database, uniquely enabling systems analysis and cross-ome correlations to molecules and patient prognoses. We mapped 219 molecular features with high significance to COVID-19 status and severity, many of which were involved in complement activation, dysregulated lipid transport, and neutrophil activation. We identified sets of covarying molecules, e.g., protein gelsolin and metabolite citrate or plasmalogens and apolipoproteins, offering pathophysiological insights and therapeutic suggestions. The observed dysregulation of platelet function, blood coagulation, acute phase response, and endotheliopathy further illuminated the unique COVID-19 phenotype. We present a web-based tool (covid-omics.app) enabling interactive exploration of our compendium and illustrate its utility through a machine learning approach for prediction of COVID-19 severity.},

	abstract = {Antiproteinases such as alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) play a role in hemostasis. A2M is highly conserved throughout evolution and is a high molecular weight homo-tetrameric glycoprotein. A2M proteinase inhibitor activity is possible via a unique cage structure leading to proteinase entrapment without direct enzymatic activity inhibition. Following this entrapment, proteinase clearance is possible through A2M binding to the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1. A2M synthesis is regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases during several chronic or acute inflammatory diseases and varies with age. For instance, A2M plasma levels are known to be increased in patients with diabetes mellitus, nephrotic syndrome, or sepsis. Concerning hemostasis, A2M can trap many proteinases involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis. Because of its pleiotropic effects A2M can be seen as both anti- and pro-hemostatic. A2M can inhibit thrombin, factor Xa, activated protein C, plasmin, tissue-plasminogen activator, and urokinase. Through its many different functions A2M is generally put apart in the balanced regulation of hemostasis. In addition, the fact that A2M plasma levels are differently regulated during inflammatory-related diseases and that A2M can neutralize cytokines that also modify hemostasis could explain why it is difficult to link common proteins and parameters of hemostasis with the mechanisms of thrombosis in such diseases. Thus, we propose in the present review to summarize known functions of A2M, give a brief overview about diseases, and then to focus on the roles of this antiproteinase in hemostasis and thrombosis.},
